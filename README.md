## üìã Project Overview

This project implements and compares different recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM and GRU) for next word prediction using Shakespeare's "Hamlet" as training data. The project also explores the impact of various regularization techniques including early stopping, L2 regularization, and dropout.

### üéØ Key Features

- **Multiple Model Architectures**: Comparison between LSTM and GRU models
- **Regularization Techniques**: Implementation of early stopping, L2 regularization , and dropout
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Streamlit app for real-time next word prediction
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Performance metrics for all model variations
- **Shakespeare Dataset**: Training on the rich, complex text of "Hamlet"

## üîç Model Comparison

| Model | Early Stopping | L2 Regularization | Dropout Rate | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | Epochs Run |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **LSTM without Early Stopping** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | 0.2 | ~65% | ~5% | 100 |
| **LSTM with L2 & Dropout 0.4** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 0.4 | 5.37% | 5.56% | 15 |
| **GRU without Early Stopping** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | 0.2 | ~77% | ~5% | 100 |
| **GRU with L2 & Dropout 0.4** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 0.4 | 6.85% | 5.89% | 14 |

> **Note**: The accuracy values represent the final training and validation accuracy at the end of training. The early stopping models stopped training much earlier (14 epochs) compared to the models without early stopping (which ran for all 100 epochs), resulting in an 86% reduction in training time. While the absolute accuracy values are low due to the complexity of next-word prediction in Shakespeare's text, the GRU model consistently outperformed LSTM with the same regularization techniques.

## üöÄ Why GRU Outperforms LSTM in This Task

The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model with L2 regularization and increased dropout (0.4) achieved the best performance in our experiments. Here's why GRU excels in this particular task:

1. **Simpler Architecture**: GRU has fewer parameters than LSTM (2 gates vs. 3 gates), making it:
   - Faster to train (14 epochs vs 100 epochs for models without early stopping)
   - Less prone to overfitting on our relatively small Shakespeare dataset
   - More efficient at capturing the linguistic patterns in the text

2. **Effective Information Flow**: GRU's update gate directly controls how much of the previous state is kept, which works particularly well for language modeling where recent context is often more important than distant context.

3. **Better Generalization**: The GRU model with L2 regularization and dropout 0.4 achieved higher training accuracy (6.85% vs 5.37%) and validation accuracy (5.89% vs 5.56%) compared to the equivalent LSTM model at the almsot same epoch count (14)-15).

## üí™ The Power of Regularization Techniques

### Early Stopping

Early stopping proved to be crucial in improving model performance:

```python
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=10,
    restore_best_weights=True
)
```

**Benefits observed**:
- **Reduced training time** by 86% (14-15 epochs vs. 100 epochs)
- **Prevented overfitting** by stopping training when validation loss started increasing
- **Automatically selected optimal model weights** from the best epoch

### L2 Regularization

L2 regularization (weight decay) was implemented in the recurrent layers:

```python
model.add(GRU(128, return_sequences=True,
              kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001))
```

**Benefits observed**:
- **Improved generalization** by penalizing large weights
- **Reduced model complexity** leading to smoother decision boundaries
- **Enhanced stability** during training with more consistent convergence

### Dropout Rate Increase (0.2 ‚Üí 0.4)

Dropout in neural networks is used to disable some neurons during training to prevent the entire model from overfitting. Increasing the dropout rate from 0.2 to 0.4 had a significant positive impact:

```python
model.add(Dropout(0.4))  # Increased from 0.2
```

**Benefits observed**:
- **Stronger regularization effect** preventing co-adaptation of neurons
- **Better generalization** with improved validation accuracy (5.89% vs 5.56%)
- **Higher training efficiency** with GRU showing better accuracy at the same epoch count

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Model Architectures

#### GRU with L2 Regularization and Dropout 0.4

```python
model_GRU_l2_dropout0_4 = Sequential()
model_GRU_l2_dropout0_4.add(Embedding(total_words, 100, input_length=max_sequence_len-1))
model_GRU_l2_dropout0_4.add(GRU(150, return_sequences=True, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.001)))
model_GRU_l2_dropout0_4.add(Dropout(0.4))
model_GRU_l2_dropout0_4.add(GRU(100, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.001)))
model_GRU_l2_dropout0_4.add(Dense(total_words, activation="softmax", kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.001)))
```

#### GRU without Early Stopping

```python
model_GRU_without_early_callback = Sequential()
model_GRU_without_early_callback.add(Embedding(total_words, 100, input_length=max_sequence_len-1))
model_GRU_without_early_callback.add(GRU(150, return_sequences=True))
model_GRU_without_early_callback.add(Dropout(0.2))
model_GRU_without_early_callback.add(GRU(100))
model_GRU_without_early_callback.add(Dense(total_words, activation="softmax"))
```

### Training Process

```python
# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='adam',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train with early stopping
history = model.fit(x_train,
                    y_train,
                    epochs=100,
                    validation_data=(x_test,y_test),
                    verbose=1,
                    callbacks=[early_stopping])
```

### Prediction Function

```python
# Function to predict the next word
def predict_next_word(model, tokenizer, text, max_sequence_len):
    token_list = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text])[0]
    if len(token_list) >= max_sequence_len:
        token_list = token_list[-(max_sequence_len-1):]  # Ensure the sequence length matches max_sequence_len-1
    token_list = pad_sequences([token_list], maxlen=max_sequence_len-1, padding='pre')
    predicted = model.predict(token_list, verbose=0)
    predicted_word_index = np.argmax(predicted, axis=1)
    for word, index in tokenizer.word_index.items():
        if index == predicted_word_index:
            return word
    return None
```

## üìä Learning Curves

The learning curves clearly demonstrate the benefits of our regularization techniques:

1. **Without Regularization**: Both LSTM and GRU models showed signs of overfitting after ~30 epochs, with validation loss increasing while training loss continued to decrease.

2. **With Regularization**: The combination of early stopping, L2 regularization, and increased dropout resulted in:
   - More stable learning curves
   - Smaller gap between training and validation loss
   - Automatic stopping at the optimal point (typically around epoch 15-20)
